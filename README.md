What is a Domain Generation Algorithm

An algorithm known as a "domain generation algorithm" is used in cybercrime and computer security to create a huge number of domain names for nefarious purposes, like botnets or malware command and control servers. Because DGAs are made to generate a huge pool of domain names that are subject to frequent changes, it is challenging for law enforcement and security researchers to prohibit or monitor illicit network traffic.

Below are some examples for legitimate manmade domains and domains generated by Domain Generation Alogorithm.

Background

To be more specific, domain generation algorithms (DGAs) are used to generate domains automatically, frequently in large quantities, within the framework of establishing a malicious command-and-control (C2) communication channel. DGA-dependent malware, including BankPatch, CryptoLocker, and Pushdo, reduces the likelihood that their live C2 servers will be blacklisted by hiding their location among many possible candidates. The time of day, cryptographic keys, or other distinct variables can all be used to produce these domains algorithmically. Even though the majority of DGA-created domains do not resolve as legitimate domains, it is crucial to locate each one in order to offer a thorough defense against a particular threat.
